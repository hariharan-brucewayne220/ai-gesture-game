# AI Gesture Gaming System - Development Memory

## Project Overview
Built a comprehensive AI-first multimodal gaming control system that combines gesture recognition, head tracking, voice commands, and hand camera control for immersive gaming experiences.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Gesture Recognition System (`gesture_detector.py`)
- **Hand gesture detection** using MediaPipe
- **Directional gestures** for movement:
  - Open palm â†’ Jump (Space)
  - Closed fist â†’ Backward (S)
  - Index point left â†’ Strafe left (A)
  - Index point right â†’ Strafe right (D) 
  - Index point up â†’ Forward (W)
  - Rock sign (index + pinky) â†’ Attack (Left Click)
- **Smart stabilization** for action vs movement gestures
- **Hand camera control** using velocity-based tracking (wrist position)

### 2. Head Tracking System (`head_tracker.py`)
- **MediaPipe Face Mesh** for head pose estimation
- **Camera control** via head movement (disabled by default to avoid neck pain)
- **Reference position** calibration system
- **Sensitivity controls** and deadzone configuration
- **pydirectinput integration** for AAA game compatibility (replaced pynput)

### 3. Voice Control System (`voice_controller.py`)
- **Real-time speech recognition** using Google Web Speech API
- **Fuzzy matching** for intent recognition (70% similarity threshold)
- **Last of Us control mappings** hardcoded for testing:
  - "flashlight" â†’ T key
  - "listen" â†’ Q key (Listen Mode)
  - "heal" â†’ 7 key (Health Kit)
  - "crouch" â†’ C key
  - "sprint" â†’ Shift key
  - "shield"/"defend" â†’ E key
  - "escape"/"flee" â†’ F key
  - Plus 15+ more voice commands
- **Audio feedback** with text-to-speech confirmations
- **High-frequency listening** optimized for gaming

### 4. Input Controller (`input_controller.py`)
- **Unified input management** for all control methods
- **pydirectinput integration** for better AAA game compatibility
- **Voice command execution** with key mapping
- **Camera movement handling** for both head and hand tracking
- **Cooldown systems** to prevent input spam

### 5. Main System (`main.py`)
- **Multimodal integration** - gestures + voice + head + hand camera
- **Real-time processing** of all input streams
- **Comprehensive keyboard controls**:
  - 'g' - Toggle hand camera control
  - 'h' - Toggle head tracking
  - 'v' - Toggle voice recognition
  - 'x' - Reset hand camera reference
  - '+/-' - Adjust hand camera sensitivity
  - 'c' - List voice commands
  - 'b' - Toggle audio feedback
  - 'p' - Pause/Resume
  - 'q' - Quit

## Technical Decisions Made

### 1. AAA Game Compatibility
- **Replaced pynput with pydirectinput** for mouse movement to bypass game input protection
- **Optimized for performance** during intensive gameplay
- **Addressed Last of Us performance issues** (120GB games vs 70GB games)

### 2. User Comfort & Safety
- **Head tracking OFF by default** to prevent neck strain during long gaming sessions
- **Hand camera control** as comfortable alternative
- **Velocity-based hand tracking** to prevent runaway camera movement
- **Adjustable sensitivity** for personal preference

### 3. Voice Recognition Strategy
- **Chose speech_recognition over Whisper** for real-time gaming (lower latency)
- **Hardcoded Last of Us controls** instead of dynamic config files for MVP testing
- **Fuzzy matching** for natural language flexibility
- **High-frequency listening loop** for responsive gaming commands

### 4. Camera Control Evolution
- **Started with head tracking** (MediaPipe Face Mesh)
- **Added hand camera control** as neck-pain-free alternative
- **Implemented velocity-based tracking** to fix continuous movement issue
- **Combined both systems** for user choice

## Key Technical Fixes

### 1. Voice Recognition Frequency Issue
**Problem**: Voice commands only recognized occasionally
**Solution**: 
- Reduced recognition timeout to 0.1s
- Optimized listening loop for continuous operation
- Added debug output for troubleshooting

### 2. Hand Camera Sensitivity Issue
**Problem**: Slight hand movements caused huge camera movements
**Solution**:
- Reduced sensitivity from 3.0x to 0.5x initially
- Implemented velocity-based tracking instead of position-based
- Added real-time sensitivity adjustment (+/- keys)

### 3. Continuous Camera Movement Issue
**Problem**: Camera kept moving when hand held in position
**Solution**:
- **Switched from position-based to velocity-based tracking**
- Camera now only moves when hand is actively moving
- Stops immediately when hand stops moving

### 4. AAA Game Input Issues
**Problem**: Mouse movement not working in games like Last of Us
**Solution**:
- Replaced pynput with pydirectinput for better game compatibility
- Configured DirectInput for lower-level access
- Added proper error handling and cooldowns
