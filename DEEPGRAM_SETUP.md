- **Natural commands**: "shoot the target" â†’ Fire
- **Context aware**: "I need health" â†’ Health Kit  
- **Noise resistant**: Works with game audio
- **Fast response**: Near real-time recognition
- **Multiple intents**: One command, multiple ways to say it

## ðŸŽ® Next Steps

1. Test accuracy with your voice
2. Try commands with game audio playing
3. Compare response time vs Google Speech
4. If satisfied, integrate into main system
